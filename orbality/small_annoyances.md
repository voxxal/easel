some small things that have bugged me while making this game
- i should be able to right click on files on the sidebar to rename or to create new files, not have to drag my mouse to the bottom left corner
- errors where a symbol is not public but exist should ask if you forgot to put `pub` on said symbol
- `hero.easel: line 14 (char 26) ".X ": identifier is not writable: X` makes me very sad :(
