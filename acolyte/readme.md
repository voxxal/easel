## Getting Started

Don't know where to begin?
- The `abilities` folder contains all the different abilities that Acolytes can use
and is probably the most interesting part of this project.
- `main.easel` is the entrypoint into the game and is so may also be a good place to start.
- `pages/home.easel` contains the homepage of the game and is the first thing people see.
